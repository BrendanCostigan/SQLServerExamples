# 70-461 Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014 Examples

Some people seem to find taking Microsoft Exams very simple, I do not. For each exam, I find a suitable book as a guide to the syllabus and then work through examples from the book, MSDN or other web pages. The book I used to guide me through this exam was 'Training Kit (Exam 70-461): Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012' by Itzik Ben-Gan, Dejan Sarka, Ron Talmage. Worth a read if you are going for the exam.

This repository contains sample SQL code principally for the exam
'70-461 Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014' however I took the Data Warehouse and SQL Administration exams as well so a few examples from these may have crept in.
